That way,         applications built on top of the W3C Semantic Technology stack can seamlessly integrate         relational data using those mappings. A major obstacle to using R2RML, though, is the effort         for manually curating the mappings. In particular in scenarios that aim to map data from         huge and complex relational schemata to more abstract ontologies efficient ways to support         the mapping creation are needed. In previous work we presented a mapping editor that aims to         reduce the effort that users need to invest for mapping creation. While assisting users in         mapping construction the editor also imposed a fixed editing approach, which turned out to         be not optimal for all users and all kinds of mapping tasks. Most prominently, it is unclear         on which of the two data models users should best start with the mapping construction. In         this paper, we present the results of a comprehensive user study that evaluates different         alternative editing approaches for constructing R2RML mapping rules. In the user study we         measure the efficiency and quality of the mapping construction to find out which approach         works better for users with different background knowledge and for different types of tasks         in order to extend our editor.","id":1142,"authors":["2489","2464","262","2889","2495","2788"],"title":"How to Best Find a Partner?

In short, they are technical means that suggest potentially relevant products         and services to the users of a Web site, typically a shop. The recommendations are computed         in advance or during the actual visit and use various types of data as input, in particular         past purchases and the purchasing behavior of other users with similar preferences. One         major problem with recommender systems is that the quality of recommendations depends on the         amount, quality, and representativeness of the in-formation about items already owned by the         visitor, e.g. from past purchases at that particular shop. For first-time visitors and         customers migrating from other merchants, the amount of available information is often too         small to generate good recommendations. In other words, shopping history data for a single         user is fragmented and spread over multiple sites, and cannot be actively exposed by the         user himself to additional shops. This creates strong lock-in effects for consumers, because         they cannot migrate from one merchant to another without losing access to high-quality         recommendations, and it creates strong market entry barriers for new merchants, since they         do not have access to the customers\u2019 shopping history with other shops. In this paper, we         propose to use Semantic Web technology, namely GoodRelations and schema.org, to empower         e-commerce customers to (1) collect and manage ownership information about products, (2)         advertise interest in sharing this information with shop sites in exchange for better         recommendations or oth-er incentives, and (3) expose the information to such shop sites         directly from their browser. We then sketch how a shop site could use the ownership         infor-mation to propose relevant products.","id":154,"authors":["2612","2245"],"title":"Towards Portable Shopping Histories: Using

User support for building data analysis workflows, however, has not progressed         sufficiently: the large number of operators currently available in KDD systems and         interactions between these operators complicates successful data analysis. To help Data         Miners we enhanced one of the most used open source data mining tools---RapidMiner---with         semantic technologies. Specifically, we first annotated all elements involved in the Data         Mining (DM) process---the data, the operators, models, data mining tasks, and KDD         workflows---semantically using our eProPlan modelling tool that allows to describe operators         and build a task\/method decomposition grammar to specify the desired workflows embedded in         an ontology. Second, we enhanced RapidMiner to employ these semantic annotations to actively         support data analysts. Third, we built an Intelligent Discovery Assistant, eIDA, that         leverages the semantic annotation as well as HTN planning to automatically support KDD         process generation. We found that the use of Semantic Web approaches and technologies in the         KDD domain helped us to lower the barrier to data analysis. We also found that using a         generic ontology editor overwhelmed KDD-centric users. We, therefore, provided them with         problem-centric extensions to protege. Last and most surprising, we found that our semantic         modeling of the KDD domain served as a rapid prototyping approach for several hard-coded         improvements of RapidMiner, namely correctness checking of workflows and quick-fixes,         reinforcing the finding that even a little semantic modeling can go a long way in improving         the understanding of a domain even for domain experts.","id":110,"authors":["2475","2806","299","2284"],"title":"\"Semantics Inside!\" But let's not tell the Data Miners:         Intelligent Support for Data Mining","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#eswc2014Kietz","track":"In-Use Track","twitter_widget":"453648885060075520","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/in-use\/47"},{"abstract":"The Web democratized publishing -- everybody can easily publish information on a         Website, Blog, in social networks or microblogging systems. The more the amount of published         information grows, the more important are technologies for accessing, analysing, summarising         and visualising information. While substantial progress has been made in the last years in         each of these areas individually, we argue, that only the intelligent combination of         approaches will make this progress truly useful and leverage further synergies between         techniques. In this paper we develop a text analytics architecture of participation, which         allows ordinary people to use sophisticated NLP techniques for analysing and visualizing         their content, be it a Blog, Twitter feed, Website or article collection. The architecture         comprises interfaces for information access, natural language processing and visualization.         Different exchangeable components can be plugged into this architecture, making it easy to         tailor for individual needs. We evaluate the usefulness of our approach by comparing both         the effectiveness and efficiency of end users within a task-solving setting. Moreover, we         evaluate the usability of our approach using a questionnaire-driven approach. Both         evaluations suggest that ordinary Web users are empowered to analyse their data and perform         tasks, which were previously out of reach.","id":167,"authors":["2228","2525","2862"],"title":"conTEXT -- Lightweight Text Analytics using Linked Data","thumbnail":"app\/img\/papers\/in-use\/logo_small.png.jpg","hashtag":"#eswc2014Khalili","track":"In-Use Track","twitter_widget":"453644274425278464","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/in-use\/36"},{"abstract":"Most libraries use the machine-readable cataloguing (MARC) format to encode and         exchange metadata about the items they make available to their patrons. Traditional library         systems have not published this data on the Semantic Web. However, some agile open source         library systems have begun closing this gap by publishing structured data that uses the         schema.org vocabulary to describe the bibliographic data, make offers for items available         for loan, and link the items to their owning libraries. This article distills the lessons         learned from implementing structured data in Evergreen, Koha, and VuFind; highlights         emerging design patterns for publishing structured data in other library systems; and traces         the influence these implementation experiences have had on the evolution of the schema.org         vocabulary.

Many companies classify products         (a) according to generic or industry-specific product classification standards, or (b) by         using proprietary category systems. Such classification systems often contain thousands of         product classes that are updated at regular intervals. This implies a large quantity of         useful information which the e-commerce Web of Data could immediately benefit from. Thus,         instead of building up product ontologies from scratch, which is costly, tedious,         error-prone, and high-maintenance, it is generally easier to derive them from existing         classifications. In this paper, we (1) describe a generic, semi-automated method for         deriving OWL ontologies from product classification standards and proprietary category         systems. Moreover, we (2) show that our approach generates logically and semantically         correct vocabularies, and (3) present the practical benefit of our approach. The resulting         product ontologies are compatible with the GoodRelations vocabulary for e-commerce and with         schema.org and can be used to enrich product and offer descriptions on the Semantic Web,         allowing for better product searches.","id":179,"authors":["2154","2245","2484","2321"],"title":"PCS2OWL: A Generic Approach for Deriving Web Ontologies from Product

In contrast with these approaches, here we focus on diachronic         topic-based communities \u2013i.e., communities of people who appear to work on semantically         related topics at the same time. These communities are interesting because their analysis         allows us to make sense of the dynamics of the research world \u2013e.g., migration of         researchers from one topic to another, new communities being spawn by older ones,         communities splitting, merging, ceasing to exist, etc. To this purpose, we are interested in         developing clustering methods that are able to handle correctly the dynamic aspects of         topic-based community formation, prioritizing the relationship between researchers who         appear to follow the same research trajectories. We thus present a novel approach called         Temporal Semantic Topic-Based Clustering (TST), which exploits a novel metric for clustering         researchers according to their research trajectories, defined as distributions of semantic         topics over time. The approach has been evaluated through an empirical study involving 25         experts from the Semantic Web and Human-Computer Interaction areas.

However, the initial implementation and experiments         were very preliminary and hence it is currently unclear whether the approach can be applied         to large and complex ontologies. Moreover, the approach so far can only support instance         queries. In the current paper we thoroughly investigate repairing as an approach to scalable         (and complete) ontology-based data access. First, we present several non-trivial         optimisations to the first prototype.

In more detail, our results show that we can compute repairs even for very large         real-world ontologies in a reasonable amount of time, that the performance overhead         introduced by repairing is negligible in small to medium sized ontologies and noticeable but         manageable in large and complex one, and that the hybrid reasoning approach can very         efficiently compute the correct answers for real-world challenging scenarios.","id":11,"authors":["2704"],"title":"Ontology-Based Data Access Using Rewriting, OWL 2 RL Systems and Repairing","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#eswc2014Stoilos","track":"Research Track","twitter_widget":"453670714415923200","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/research\/146"},{"abstract":"Networks of citations are a key tool for referencing, disseminating and evaluating         research results.

When processing data streams system builders are faced with         the conundrum of guaranteeing a constant maximum response time with limited resources and,         possibly, no prior information on the data arrival frequency. One approach to address this         issue is to delete data from a cache during processing \u2013 a process we call eviction. The         goal of this paper is to show that data-driven eviction outperforms today\u2019s dominant         data-agnostic approaches such as first-in-first-out or random deletion. Specifically, we         first introduce a method called Clock that evicts data from a join cache based on the         likelihood estimate of contributing to a join in the future. Second, using the         well-established SR-Bench benchmark as well as a data set from the IPTV domain, we show that         Clock outperforms data-agnostic approaches indicating its usefulness for resource limited         linked data stream processing.","id":1185,"authors":["2877","2806","2594"],"title":"The CLOCK Data-Aware Eviction Approach: Towards Processing Linked Data Streams with         Limited Resources","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#eswc2014Gao","track":"Research Track","twitter_widget":"453661558648750080","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/research\/118"},{"abstract":"To make digital resources on the web verifiable, immutable, and permanent, we         propose a technique to include cryptographic hash values in URIs. We call them trusty URIs         and we show how they can be used for approaches like nanopublications to make not only         specific resources but their entire reference trees verifiable. Digital artifacts can be         identified not only on the byte level but on more abstract levels such as RDF graphs, which         means that resources keep their hash values even when presented in a different format. Our         approach sticks to the core principles of the web, namely openness and decentralized         architecture, is fully compatible with existing standards and protocols, and can therefore         be used right away.

User involvement is         considered as a valuable source of human knowledge that helps identify coreferent entities.         However, the quality of user involvement is not always satisfying, which significantly         diminishes the coreference accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new approach called         coCoref, which leverages distributed human computation and consensus partition for entity         coreference. Consensus partition is used to aggregate all distributed user-judged         coreference results and resolve their disagreements. To alleviate user involvement, ensemble         learning is performed on the consensus partition to automatically identify coreferent         entities that users have not judged. We integrate coCoref into an online Linked Data         browsing system, so that users can participate in entity coreference with their daily Web         activities.

However, the knowledge bases they produce still lack a         clean, explicit semantic data model. This, on the other hand, could be provided by         full-fledged semantic networks like DBpedia or Yago, which, in turn, would benefit from the         additional coverage provided by Web-scale IE. In this paper, we bring these two strains of         research together, and present a method to align terms from Nell with instances in DBpedia.         Our approach is unsupervised in nature and relies on two key components. First, we         automatically acquire probabilistic type information for Nell terms given a set of matching         hypotheses.

To this         aim, keyword-based search is considered an essential feature of database systems. The         distributed nature of the Semantic Web demands query processing techniques to evolve towards         a scenario where data is scattered on distributed data stores. Existing approaches to         keyword search cannot guarantee scalability in a distributed environment, because, at         runtime, they are unaware of the location of the relevant data to the query and thus, they         cannot optimize join tasks. In this paper, we illustrate a novel distributed approach to         keyword search over RDF data that exploits the MapReduce paradigm by switching the problem         from graph-parallel to data-parallel processing. Moreover, our framework is able to consider         ranking during the building phase to return directly the best (top-k) answers in the first         (k) generated results, reducing greatly the overall computational load and complexity.

In general, any result of a Knowledge Discovery process,         including clusters, is interpreted by human experts who use their background knowledge to         explain them. However, for someone without such expert knowledge, those results may be         difficult to understand. Obtaining a complete and satisfactory explanation becomes a         laborious and time-consuming process, involving expertise in possibly different domains.         Having said so, not only does the Web of Data contain vast amounts of such background         knowledge, but it also natively connects those domains. While the efforts put in the         interpretation process can be reduced with the support of Linked Data, how to automatically         access the right piece of knowledge in such a big space remains an issue. Dedalo is a         framework that dynamically traverses Linked Data to find commonalities that form         explanations for items of a cluster. We have developed different strategies (or heuristics)         to guide this traversal, reducing the time to get the best explanation.

Blank nodes are used for various purposes (e.g. for describing complex attributes),         and a significant percentage of resources is currently represented with blank nodes.

In our study, we analysed 11 datasets using the Lemon and NIF vocabularies         in 277 test cases and point out common quality issues.","id":1225,"authors":["2816","2171","23","2789","257"],"title":"NLP data cleansing based on Linguistic Ontology constraints","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#eswc2014Kontokostas","track":"Research Track","twitter_widget":"453669342270328833","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/research\/202"},{"abstract":null,"id":1120,"authors":["2162","2188","2554","2500","2586"],"title":"Modelling OWL ontologies with Graffoo","thumbnail":"app\/img\/papers\/demo\/114.png.jpg","hashtag":"#eswc2014DemoFalco","track":"Demo Track","twitter_widget":"469421467378008064","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/demo\/114"},{"abstract":null,"id":137,"authors":["2411","2441"],"title":"Olap4LD -

This phenomenon, known as co-reference, increases the probability of leaving         out implicit semantically related results when querying Linked Data. The probability of         co-reference increases further when considering distributed SPARQL queries over a larger set         of distributed datasets. Addressing co-reference in Linked Data queries, on one hand,         increases complexity of query processing. On the other hand, it requires changes in how         statistics of datasets are taken into consideration. We investigate these two challenges of         addressing co-reference in distributed SPARQL queries, and propose two methods to improve         query efficiency: 1) a model named Virtual Graph, that transforms a query with co-reference         into a normal query with pre-existing bindings; 2) an algorithm named $\\Psi$, that         intensively exploits parallelism, and dynamically optimises queries using runtime         statistics. We deploy both methods in an distributed engine called LHD-d. To evaluate LHD-d,         we investigate the distribution of co-reference in the real world, based on which we         simulate an experimental RDF network. In this environment we demonstrate the advantages of         LHD-d for distributed SPARQL queries in environments with co-reference.","id":114,"authors":["2483","2611","2724"],"title":"Optimising Linked Data Queries Using Runtime Statistics in the Presence of         Co-reference","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#eswc2014Wang","track":"Research Track","twitter_widget":"453636927153909760","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/research\/20"},{"abstract":"A primary challenge to Web data integration is coreference resolution, namely         identifying entity descriptions from different data sources that refer to the same         real-world entity. Increasingly, solutions to coreference resolution have humans in the         loop. For instance, many active learning, crowdsourcing, and pay-as-you-go approaches         solicit user feedback for verifying candidate coreferent entities computed by automatic         methods. Whereas reducing the number of verification tasks is a major consideration for         these approaches, very little attention has been paid to the efficiency of performing each         single verification task. To address this issue, in this paper, instead of showing the         entire descriptions of two entities for verification which are possibly lengthy, we propose         to extract and present a compact summary of them, and expect that such length-limited         comparative entity summaries can help human users verify more efficiently without         significantly hurting the accuracy of their verification. Our approach exploits the common         and different features of two entities that best help indicate (non-)coreference, and also         considers the diverse information on their identities. Experimental results show that         verification is 2.7--2.9 times faster when using our comparative entity summaries, and its         accuracy is not notably affected.","id":135,"authors":["2434","2230","2848"],"title":"Facilitating Human Intervention in Coreference Resolution with Comparative Entity         Summaries","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#eswc2014Xu","track":"Research Track","twitter_widget":"453638262985216000","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/research\/26"},{"abstract":null,"id":1204,"authors":["2162","2468","2102","2814","2140"],"title":"Semantic Web-based Sentiment Analysis","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#SSA2014Reforgiato","track":"Workshop Track","twitter_widget":"469435222606348289","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/ws\/SSA\/5"},{"abstract":null,"id":140,"authors":["2547","2546","2652","2267"],"title":"Usage of Abstract Features in Semantic Sentiment Analysis","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#SSA2014Almashraee","track":"Workshop Track","twitter_widget":"469434845823631362","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/ws\/SSA\/3"},{"abstract":null,"id":1154,"authors":["2305","2179","232","2689","2286"],"title":"Sentiment Analysis for Dynamic User Preference Inference in Spoken Dialogue Systems","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#SSA2014Vanrompay","track":"Workshop Track","twitter_widget":"469435108542275585","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/ws\/SSA\/4"},{"abstract":null,"id":162,"authors":["2670","2249","2334","2417"],"title":"Adapting Sentiment Lexicons using Contextual Semantics for Twitter Sentiment Analysis","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#SSA2014Saif","track":"Workshop Track","twitter_widget":"469434955676647425","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/ws\/SSA\/2"},{"abstract":"This event is not associated to a paper presentation","id":777,"authors":[],"title":"other event","thumbnail":null,"subject":[],"hashtag":"#otherEvent","track":"","twitter_widget":"none","uri":null,"presenter":666}]
